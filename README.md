# DataThon â€” Dynamic Supply Chain & Logistics

This repository contains our final solution for the **2025 SUDATA Ã— SUBAA Datathon**.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `hachathon.Rmd` â€” Main RMarkdown notebook with full analysis, forecasting, and accuracy evaluation.
- `dynamic_supply_chain_logistics_dataset.csv/` â€” Saved cleaned datasets (CSV).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have **R (â‰¥ 4.2)** and RStudio (optional).  
Install the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c(
  "readr","dplyr","tidyr","stringr","lubridate","ggplot2",
  "naniar","visdat","corrplot","hexbin","zoo",
  "tsibble","fable","fabletools"
))

And Run

3. Project Workflow

The notebook is structured as follows:
	1.	Data Loading & Cleaning â€” handles missing values and prepares features.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€” visual insights (costs vs congestion, risk class distributions, correlations).
	3.	Feature Engineering â€” time aggregations (daily, weekly, rolling averages).
	4.	Hierarchical Forecasting â€” using ETS with reconciliation methods (Bottom-Up, OLS, WLS).
	5.	Evaluation â€” accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAPE, sMAPE, WAPE, CV backtesting).
	6.	Business Insight â€” coherence checks and potential savings from improved forecasts.
	7.	Artifacts Export â€” cleaned data + results are written to CSV for easy sharing.

4. Reproducibility
	â€¢	All random processes use set.seed(42).
	â€¢	Missing values are filled consistently (zero for additive costs).
	â€¢	Safe metrics wrapper prevents infinite MAPE errors.
